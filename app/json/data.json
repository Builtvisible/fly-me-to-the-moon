				"content": "**The date is August 2nd, 1955**. The USSR responds to the American declaration of intent, just four days earlier, to put satellites in to space, with a simple message: if you want to do it, we'll do it too, and faster. These two announcements come during the escalating the Cold War. Tensions are increasing, with both sides having recently demonstrated the capability to create a portable hydrogen bomb. With the memory of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki both still less than ten years old, the prospect of weapons with a thousand times the power ushers in the era of \"duck and cover\". And yet, the still infant science of rocketry, developed in the aftermath of World War II, promises more than just the prospect of global annihilation. It's a time when both countries, using the knowledge of their captured German engineers, have begun developing modern rocket arsenals to create intercontinental ballistic missiles. It will culminate in a mere 14 years with men walking on the surface of the moon, and spawn a legacy that continues onwards to today's exploration of the solar system and beyond. \n\nOur story begins however, at the end stages of the Second World War.\n\n### The Bloody Phoenix\n\nTowards the end of WW2 in 1944, Hitler's Nazi Germany faced catastrophic defeat. With his options limited, he ordered the use of a new, secret weapon. Designed as a tool to retaliate against the bombing of German cities by the allies, this weapon can travel at four times the speed of sound, travel 200 miles, cross the boundary of space, and deliver almost a tonne of explosive.\n\nIt was called the Vergeltungswaffe 2 (Retribution Weapon 2), or simply the V-2 for short.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col-inverse col-xs-6 col-right\">\n![The V-2 rocket assembled](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/v-2_assembled.jpg)\n<figcaption>The V-2 rocket assembled in the Peenemünde Museum</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThen U.S. Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps, is ordered to a top secret meeting convened by the British, which will discuss the V-2 rocket. His superior, Colonel Holger Toftoy has orders to capture a V-2 at any cost. The Americans have realised that if they can create their own variant on the V-2, and combine it with their own secret project, the atom bomb, they will have military superiority over the rest of the world for years to come.\n\nToftoy gave Staver a simple order: capture the lead German scientist on the V-2 project, a man called Wernher von Braun. Von Braun was, at the time, stationed in Peenemünde in northern Germany, but the Americans had a problem. The Soviets were currently in Poland, pushing the Nazi forces back, where they'd discovered something the Americans would have literally killed for - the intact shell of a V-2, abandoned in the retreat. They already had the vessel, and in days, they'd reach von Braun.\n\nWhile the Soviet forces were less than 100 miles away, von Braun assembled his planning staff and gave them a choice. They would be attacked soon, and their research was too valuable to be lost. As a result, he presented them with two simple options: surrender to the Soviets, or the allied forces of the West. Afraid of the Soviet forces and their reprisals against Germans, even prisoners of war, von Braun and his staff decided on the latter, and to surrender to the Americans if possible. Fortuitously, they have been given two conflicting sets of orders: to relocate to central Germany, and also to join the army and fight. They believed that the former offered the greatest chance of giving an opportunity to defect to the advancing American forces, von Braun moved his people to close to Nordhausen, to the Mittelwerk facility, where they resumed their work. Determined to continue his progress, he knows that whilst the rockets they're working on can be used for destruction, he can also see their potential for manned use.\n\nBy March, the Soviets are on the outskirts of Berlin. However, for all the the Nazi regieme is about to fall, they aren't any closer to capturing von Braun or his team. Preparing for the possibility they may not be able to reach them before the Americans do, they decide to put together a team to work on rocketry in the absence of the Nazi scientists. There was just one problem. The man who they needed to lead the team, and the man recommended by their leading rocket scientist (Ivan Kleymyonov), had been sent to the Gulag, put after being tortured and forced to confess to deliberately slowing research into rockets. That man was Sergei Korolev. Currently, Korolev was in a Sharashka, a Soviet prison for intellectual prisoners. Slave labour camps in all but name, those there were forced to work on projects dictated by the Soviet party.\n\nIn April, as the Allied forces advanced into Germany, von Braun and his top 500 scientists were ordered to the Bavarian Alps. The Americans were getting too close, and the fear was that the scientists and their research would fall into enemy hands. Ordered to destroy their research, von Braun instead had his men hide their papers in a disused mine, destroying as much as they needed to to appear to be following orders. Then, under guard by the SS, who were given orders to execute the team if they were over-run and to fall into enemy hands, or if Germany lost the war, they set off on a train to the Alps. The soldiers sent were fanatical and on edge, and knew the end would occur in weeks at most.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col col-xs-6 col-left\">\n![A cutaway drawing of the V-2 rocket](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/v-2_cutaway.jpg)\n<figcaption>V-2 cutaway drawing (U.S. Air Force photo)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOnly days after they left, the Americans arrived and found the remains of the V-2 mass production plant which had produced over 5,000 V-2 rockets. It wasn't empty though - in the rush to leave, the Nazi forces had left 100 intact V-2 rockets. They also found the slave labour and concentration camp nearby, Mittelbau-Dora. Over 20,000 dead were found there, with another 40,000 survivors freed. More were killed creating the rockets, than by their use. The American team called in Staver and his people, who released immediately what this represented. He ordered the rockets to be broken down and shipped back, starting the single largest movement of material for the entire war. Knowing that the factory would fall under Soviet control, Staver was given less than a month to complete the operation.\n\nAt the same time, Korolev had been recalled from the Gulag and transported to Germany, to lead a research and design department looking at the V-2 rocket, advancing the technology for Soviet purposes. Here, he was reunited with Kleymyonov, who was tasked with developing rocket engines.\n\nBack in the Alps, von Braun was able to convince the SS Major in charge that if they were grouped together, they'd be an easy target for the US bombing raids and other retaliatory strikes. They were therefore ordered to spread out into a collection of villages. As a result, when it was announced that Hitler had committed suicide and the SS troops went to find the scientists, they only found empty beds. Von Braun and his people had swiftly fled to Austria, the moment they could. On May 2, 1945, upon finding an American private from the U.S. 44th Infantry Division, von Braun's brother and fellow rocket engineer, Magnus, approached the soldier on a bicycle, calling out in broken English:\n\n> \"My name is Magnus von Braun. My brother invented the V-2. We want to surrender.\"\n\n### The Post-War Scientists\n\nIn 1943, Werner Osenberg, the head of the German Military Research Association, or Wehrforschungsgemeinschaft, had created a list of the top scientists and engineers of the age. In 1945, Staver managed to get hold of that list, and used it to create a hit list of people the Americans wanted to capture. At the top, was von Braun. His knowledge would, they knew, prove invaluable. Thus the capture of von Braun was a huge coup of the Americans, and the loss felt by the Soviets, despite their creation of their own team, was equally huge. Stalin's reaction perhaps best sums up the feeling of the Soviet leadership:\n\n> \"This is absolutely intolerable. We defeated the Nazi armies; we occupied Berlin and Peenemunde, but the Americans got the rocket engineers. What could be more revolting and inexcusable?\"\n\nStaver was then tasked with Operation Overcast, the American plan to interrogate the German scientists. What von Braun and the others had to say though made him decide to write to his superiors, and urge their evacuation. As it grew, the beginnings of Operation Paperclip were forming. In total, over 1,500 German intellectuals would be brought to America from previously occupied European countries, with the aims of denying the advanced German scientific expertise to the Soviet Union and United Kingdom, whilst also preventing Germany from redeveloping its military research.\n\nVon Braun was taken to America shortly after, and along with over 100 of his men he was escorted to Fort Bliss, whilst the Soviets were left with the now derelict V-2 plant. However, the Soviets didn't realise just how outmatched they currently were, until the 6th August, 1945. With the bombing of Hiroshima, and then Nagasaki shortly after, they realised that the Americans now had both the intelligence with which to make long range rockets, and a payload that could flatten cities. This was a terrifying, and immediate threat.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col col-xs-12\">\n![A rusty V-2 rocket engine](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/V-2_Mittelbau_engine.jpg)\n<figcaption>A rusty V-2 rocket engine in the underground production facilities at Dora-Mittelbau, Nordhausen</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nBack in Nordhausen , the Soviets put out a call for anyone who'd worked on the V-2 rockets to come and help them restart the rocket facility and to continue their research. A few did, including Helmut Gröttrup, wouldn't been von Braun's assistant and had developed the radio guidance system for the V-2. Having helped the Soviets get a V-2 engine to fire, he's promised that he can stay in Germany. In short order however, on 22 October 1946, he was betrayed. He and the other newly captured engineers, were deported to Moscow with their families as part of Operation Osoaviakhim. Over 2,000 other German intellectuals were moved with him, deported to Russia to aid the Soviet research programs. Once there, they were tasked with reproducing the technical drawings for the V-2, to enable research to begin again. It would take two years to compile the entire new set of blueprints. The rockets constructed had a dismal record though, and shortly after, research would begin on the R-1, the first Soviet rocket system. It had it's first launch scheduled for the 17th September 1948. Trials and refinement of the missile continued, until on the 25th November 1950, it was accepted into service. For Gröttrup and his team however, it was the beginning of the end of their usefulness. Too powerful, and too useful, they hid them away, and consigned them to quiet work, back in Germany.\n\nIn the meantime, things weren't going well in America for von Braun and his people. The program had become nicknamed Operation Icebox, due to the lack of activity. The captured Germans were kept isolated, but given no work, left to their own devices. The American military had decided to focus on air and submarine delivery systems for their weapons, rather than rocketry, leaving their captured geniuses in a state of limbo.\n\n### The Cold War Heightens\n\nIn 1952, tensions between the USSR and America grew further, as America tested the first hydrogen bomb, then the most powerful weapon ever detonated, and by a huge margin. Ivy Mike as it was known, was an 74 ton building, designed to test the theory of a Teller-Ulam fusion bomb. \n\nThe 10.4 megaton blast was almost 700 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima. It left a crater 1.2 miles wide and 164 feet (50 metres) deep and blasted radioactive coral into the stratosphere, from where it fell to land on ships as far as 35 miles away. The Soviets responded by detonating their own a year later. Which didn't exactly cool things down."

				"content": "Whilst Gröttrup had been sidelined at the turn of the 50's, Sergei Korolev was still active and had been tasked with a new challenge: create a rocket with enough range to reach America, whilst carrying a five tonne payload, the expected weight of a thermonuclear device. Meanwhile, in back America, von Braun was tasked with creating short range rockets, his dreams of creating rockets to send humans to space in tatters. Instead, they were working on the Hermes series of rockets, which were around 25% of the size of a V-2, with a maximum range of just 38 miles. \n\nAnd then, in 1953, whilst working on the Hermes A-3B (a slightly larger rocket), funding was cut, and a year later, the project was canned entirely. Von Braun himself was the focus of attacks by the US media, who reminded the public of his history as an officer in the SS. During this time though, he'd realised that if the military wouldn't take notice of his ideas, maybe he could win the support he needed appealing to the American public. \n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col-inverse col-xs-4 col-right\">\n![The Soviet R-7 rocket](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/r-7_rocket.png)\n<figcaption>A 2-view drawing of the R-7 Semyorka</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOn May 14, 1950, shortly after he and his team were transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and the beginning of the Korean War, The Huntsville Times published the article \"Dr. von Braun Says Rocket Flights Possible to Moon\". At the same time, his team had started work on the Redstone rocket, which led to both the development of the first high-precision inertial guidance system, and a launch system capable of carrying a nuclear payload. His concepts in his ongoing writings, which included ideas for a space station would, in 1968, be presented on the silver screen as the basis for Space Station V in 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, it was his work with Walt Disney's Disney studios as technical director that initially let him bring his vision to the public at scale. \"Man in Space\", aired on March 9, 1955, drawing 42 million viewers and becoming unofficially the second-highest rated television show in American history. Von Braun had found a way to tap into the American public's consciousness, in a way he'd never been able to truly manage with the military. Overnight, he became a household name, and behind the scenes, things start to go his way.\n\nBack in Russia, Korolev was busy working on his ideas for putting a satellite into space. Having teamed up with Valentin Glushko, another of the men who'd had a hand in sending Korolev to the Gulag, Korolev proposed a unique idea: the R-7. A rocket with several engines, including detachable rockets which would fall away to leave a central rocket to continue on. Such a rocket could both act as the delivery system the military want, and put satellites into space, as he wanted. There were only three problems. Firstly, no-one had ever built anything close to such a rocket, secondly, the military had no interest in satellites, and three, it would be so huge, there was nowhere where it could be built.\n\nThe first would be overcome by research, the second didn't matter to his military backers, they just wouldn't fund satellite research, and the third? Well, the third would result in the creation of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan, the world's first and largest operational space launch facility. \n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col col-xs-12\">\n![The Baikonur Cosmodrome launchpad](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/Baikonur_Cosmodrome_Soyuz_launch_pad.jpg)\n<figcaption>The modern Soyuz launch pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAmerica, however, had other ideas. Whilst Korolev couldn't sell the idea of satellites to the Russians, America liked the idea. Under the cover of launching a scientific instrument, but actually wanting to develop orbital spying technology, America announced its intention to put a satellite in space. At the same time as von Braun was applying for, and receiving citizenship of the United States, ten years after leaving Germany, he found himself bidding against the US Navy for a satellite contract. Just at the point where Korolev was on the verge of a breakthrough, von Braun received the news that the contract had been awarded to the Navy. His dreams would have to wait for another day. For Korolev though, they were about to come true.\n\n### Sputnik\n\nWhile visiting the Baikonur facility, then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was shown the R-7, and Korolev was able to argue for sending his satellite project. Finally, after pointing out the Americans would get there first if the Soviets didn't, Khrushchev gave the go ahead. Dozens of institutes were involved in what became known as Project D. This turned into a logistical nightmare though, and the project dragged. Far worse though, on the first two tests of the R-7 rocket, the massively complex system with its 32 rocket engines and 280 tonne weight, failed disastrously.\n\nAs the Cold War escalated and the weapons became ever larger, finally the American military condescended to give von Braun his funding and to build medium range rockets. However, the focus was still very much on a delivery system for weapons payloads. The result was the Jupiter-C. Far smaller and simpler than the Russian R-7 rocket, it would nonetheless be more than capable of putting a small satellite into orbit. In fact, the administration was so suspicious of von Braun and his team, that inspectors from the Pentagon were sent to monitor the maiden launch, to ensure they didn't try and send a satellite up anyway. Despite the interference, and suspicion, von Braun's launch was a success. America now had a rocket capable of putting systems into orbit. The balance had shifted back in America's favour.\n\nIn Baikonur, on 21 August 1957, after two failed launches, Korolev was in a difficult situation. His rocket, massively ambitious but also massively complex, had eaten vast amounts of both time and money, and so far had nothing to show for it other than two very expensive fireworks shows. As a result, tensions must have been high. But thankfully, at 12:25, the R-7 launches successfully for the first time. The world now has its first intercontinental ballistic missile. In the meantime, massively frustrated at the increasing complexity, as well as the design and construction issues with the Project D satellite, his team have been working hard to re-develop the concept to something far simpler. In less than a month, they design and build and entire new system. The new design, consisting of little more than a polished metal sphere, a transmitter, thermal measuring instruments, and batteries, weighed about the same as a man.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col col-xs-12\">\n![The Soviet R-7 rocket](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/sputnik_1.jpg)\n<figcaption>A replica of Sputnik 1 at National Air and Space Museum</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFinally on 4 October 1957, at 19:28, on an R-7, the R-7 launched, and at 00:03, Sputnik became the first object to be placed in orbit by mankind. The USSR had won the race to space."

				"content": "### A Call to Space\n\nThe effects on the two world superpowers couldn't have been more different. In the USSR, Khrushchev was pleased with this success, and decreed that it should be followed up by an encore for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, on November 3rd, just 30 days away. The result of that would be Sputnik 2. In the US though, the launch was met with incredulity and disbelief. Indeed, Vice President Richard Nixon proclaimed it a hoax. When they realised however that both the launch and Sputnik were in fact real, the collective Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program must more advanced than it actually was. This was a belief Khrushchev was more than happy to encourage, as he stated in an interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed.\n\nThe result of Khrushchev's pronouncement was Sputnik 2, which put the first living creature in to space; a small stray dog, named Laika. Before the launch, Dr. Vladimir Yazdovsky, one of the scientists on the project, took Laika home to play with his children. In a book chronicling the story of Soviet space medicine, he remembered:\n\n> \"I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live.\"\n\nSadly, after only a few hours in space, Laika died of overheating, a fact that wasn't revealed until as recently as 2002.\n\nFinally, after years of being held back, and being told that the US Navy must be given a shot before he can have his turn, von Braun is given the go-ahead to attempt to put an American satellite into orbit. He named it Explorer. The Navy prepared it's own Vanguard rocket, which was as then untested. The world's media turned up, watched the rocket lift three feet from the pad, and then explode in a huge fireball. The only surviving piece was the satellite, which fell to the ground and began to transmit. The press response was scathing, labelling it \"Kaputnik\" and other less than flattering names. As Time Magazine noted:\n\n> But in the midst of the cold war, Vanguard's cool scientific goal proved to be disastrously modest: the Russians got there first. The post-Sputnik White House explanation that the U.S. was not in a satellite \"race\" with Russia was not just an after-the-fact alibi. Said Dr. Hagen ten months ago: \"We are not attempting in any way to race with the Russians.\" But in the eyes of the world, the U.S. was in a satellite race whether it wanted to be or not, and because of the Administration's costly failure of imagination, Project Vanguard shuffled along when it should have been running. It was still shuffling when Sputnik's beeps told the world that Russia's satellite program, not the U.S.'s, was the vanguard.\n\nWhether the US wanted to be in a race was irrelevant - the media had deemed it so, and now it was up to them to respond. With no other option, the administration gave von Braun and his team their shot.\n\nOn the 31st January 1958, at 22:48, von Braun's Juno I, a Jupiter-C derived rocket, launched with Explorer on-board. Less than two hours later, America had its own satellite. The race to put a man in space was on."

				"content": "**With the arrival** of the age of the satellite, both the USSR and United States have set their sights on the next goal: putting a man in space, and bringing him safely back home. No mean feat, given the challenges involved. Putting an object in orbit is one thing - making a vessel able to carry a man, keep him alive with the vacuum of space less than a metre away, ensuring he survives not just the ascent but re-entry, and returning him to Earth without the end of the journey killing him too. It's a massive step beyond anything that's been tried before, and both countries know it.\n\nMore than that, the man who's going to accept such a mission must be highly trained, completely loyal, and understand he may well not return. He needs to have what will become known as \"The Right Stuff\".\n\nIn the US, the Americans were busy finding their people. President Eisenhower insisted that all candidates be test pilots. In addition, anyone chosen could be no taller than 5' 11\" (180cm), weigh no more than 12st 12lbs (82 kg), be under 40 years old, hold a Bachelor's degree or similar, and have logged 1,500 hours or more of flight time. The newly created NASA searched for people who met all the requirements given, and identified in total 110 pilots who fit the bill. 69 were brought to Washington DC in two groups but due to the level of interest and commitment from the first two groups, the final 41 were never asked to submit themselves for testing. And testing it was; candidates had to spend hours on treadmills and tilt tables, to test cardiovascular function and resistance to motion sickness, they had their feet placed in buckets of ice water, and had to receive a series of enemas. 39 failed or dropped out before or during the first phase of exams, and more refused to take part in the second round of tests. In total, just 18 made it through.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col col-xs-12\">\n![The Mercury Seven astronauts](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/mercury_seven.jpg)\n<figcaption>The Mercury Seven astronauts in front of a U.S.A.F. F-106B. From left to right: Carpenter, Cooper, Glenn, Grissom, Schirra, Shepard & Slayton</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFrom a nation of 157 million souls, the selection process had done its work, finally presenting seven men. Each had excellent mental and athletic abilities, and were considered the best for the job. They were Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton, the Mercury Seven.\n\nNASA finally introduced their future astronauts in Washington on April 9, 1959. Although internally Project Mercury was planned simply to test the if humans could be sent to space and returned safely, the concept of American men in space electrified the nation. They were instantly seen as dare-devil explorer heroes, with TIME magazine going so far as to compare them to \"Columbus, Magellan, Daniel Boone, and the Wright brothers.\" Two hundred reporters overflowed the room used for the announcement, and upon the meeting's conclusion, gave rapturous applause.\n\nIn Russia meanwhile, secrecy is everything. Those being interviewed aren't told who they'd be working for, or what they'd be doing. Known as the Vostok programme, the selection criteria is at one focused and abstract. Potential cosmonauts had to be qualified Air Force pilots, as they would be more used to exposure to the extreme g-forces likely to be experienced. Beyond that, the candidates had to be intelligent, physically fit, mentally resilient, male, between 25 and 30 years of age, no taller than 5' 7.5\" (175cm), and no heavier than 11st 5lbs (72kg). Their tests were similarly arduous, exposing candidates to extreme low pressure, high G in a centrifuge and more. Unlike NASA's astronaut however, the Soviet group were less experienced aviators, with the Soviet R-7 being more automated than the American systems at the time.\n\nFinally, the group was whittled down to just six men, who'd become known as the Vanguard Six: Yuri Gagarin, Valerij Bykovskiy, Grigoriy Nelyubov, Andriyan Nikolayev, Pavel Popovich and German Titov. Initially, Anatoli Kartashov and Valentin Varlamov had been on the team, instead of Bykovskiy and Nelyubov, but during training, two Kartashov suffered an injury whilst in a centrifuge, and Varlamov injured his spine in a diving accident. Both were replaced, and training continued.\n\nWhilst the focus on both sides was on selecting men for space, progress was being rapidly made in the realm of satellites. Vanguard 1, which remains orbitting in space some 56 years later had been launched in March of 1958, along with Sputnik 3 in May. From there on though, only the US would continue the push to put satellites in orbit, with a further 14 attempts before 1960, but with a painful 9 failing to be put into orbit, several resulting in the complete destruction of the rockets and payloads involved.\n\nThe dream of consistent, safe spaceflight still seemed a long way off. The thought of launching human payloads shortly must have seemed daunting, to say the least.\n\n### A Scientific Outlet\n\nThe Cold War had continued to intensify, but the public interest in the developing space race had given both sides an outlet - domination of space, and of each side's scientific teams had created a way for each side to show its own capabilities, outside of the military domain.\n\nThe men chosen to go to space were undoubtedly capable, on both sides. But it must have been a reminder that there was a good chance they'd be killed, every time they watched a rocket test, and it ended in disaster. And this wasn't a rare event - after watching an Atlas ICBM explode shortly after launch, Grissom remarked \"Are we really going to get on top of one of those things?\". With the ongoing failures of the Atlas systems, NASA started to look back to an old friend - Wernher von Braun. Von Braun had developed the Redstone missile, also capable of putting a man in space, and the vessel which had put America's first satellite into orbit. The Redstone has a problem though; it's not currently capable of carrying a human and keeping them alive, and unlike the USSR's R-7 rocket, which has thrust to spare, the Redstone is only barely capable of reaching space.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col col-left col-xs-6\">\n![The far side of the moon](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/Luna_3_moon.jpg)\n<figcaption>The first photo of the far side of the moon, taken by Luna 3</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nHowever, whilst von Braun was working to try and develop a version of the Redstone capable of manned flight, the Soviet team were powering ahead with other missions. They gained a massive political advantage when, on September 14th, the Luna 2 probe impacted the Moon, east of Mare Imbrium near the craters Aristides, Archimedes, and Autolycus. In doing so, it became the first spacecraft to reach the surface of the Moon, and the first man-made object to react a celestial body beyond the Earth. This was no Sputnik either - unlike the satellite sent up less than a year earlier, this was a full scientific device, with scintillation and geiger counters, a magnetometer, Cherenkov detectors, and micrometeorite detectors. The timing was impeccable. The leader of the USSR, Nikita Khrushchev was in America when the news broke. Just three weeks later, another Soviet probe, Luna 3, will swing around the far side of the moon and photograph it, something also never before done.\n\nAnd things were only getting worse for NASA. It had emerged that the Mercury capsule didn't fit on the Redstone rocket. The project, almost a year behind schedule already, was slipping further. If things were bad for von Braun though, one can only imagine what his Soviet counterpart, Sergei Korolev felt. For all the success Korolev was having with his Luna rockets, based on his R-7 design, the Soviets were looking in to using a separate system, built by another team. To counter this threat, he created a plan for an audacious mission: the first to take a living creature to space and return.\n\nAfter months of preparation and testing, on July 28th 1960, a Vostok-L rocket with a Vostok-1K spacecraft carried two space dogs, named Chayka and Lisichka. 28 seconds into the flight, an explosion destroyed the spacecraft shortly after launch. Undeterred, the next mission, designated Korabl-Sputnik 2, was launched merely weeks later. And so it was that, on August 19, 1960, two dogs named Belka and Strelka, along with a variety of mice and insects became the first living beings recovered from orbit, having been in to space.\n\nMore though, it was conclusive, incontrovertible proof that the USSR could send a man into space. With a ship that didn't need a pilot, just someone along for the ride, it was now just a matter of time.\n\nAmerica hadn't even yet managed to get a crewed vessel off the ground. Attempting a launch test of the Mercury-Redstone 1 on November 7th, last minute problems caused an abort to be called. The flight was rescheduled for the 21st, and at 09:00 local time, the rocket fired, rose four inches, and then immediately landed again.\n\nAfter which the capsule's escape rocket jettisoned itself, leaving the capsule behind. Then, three seconds later, the capsule itself deployed its drogue parachute, along with the the main and reserve parachutes moments later, ejecting the radio antenna in the process. The only thing that had been successfully launched was the escape rocket, which wasn't supposed to have done anything. Now though, there was a bigger problem: the active Redstone, with its full compliment of fuel, was now sitting on the launch pad with nothing whatsoever securing it.\n\nSuffice to say, this wasn't to plan."

Over the next day, the batteries ran down, and the oxidiser boiled away into the atmosphere. The failure and subsequent panic in the control room led Kraft to declare:\n\n> \"That is the first rule of flight control. If you don't know what to do, don't do anything.\"\n\n### Mounting Tensions and Soviet Disaster\n\nIn 1960, amid mounting tensions, things suddenly took a turn for the worse. On 1 May, 15 days before the the east–west summit conference in Paris was set to begin, Captain Francis Gary Powers, flew from the US base in Peshawar in a U-2 spy plane, on a mission to overfly the Soviet Union, photographing locations including ICBM sites at the Baikonur and Plesetsk Cosmodromes, before land at Bodø in Norway. He was shot down near Kosulino, in the Ural Region, by the an SA-2 Guideline (S-75 Dvina) surface-to-air missile. He was captured soon after parachuting safely down onto Russian soil. His capture was a political nightmare. President Eisenhower was left with two choices: he could take responsibility for the U-2 flight, and in doing so destroy his credibility for the Summit in two weeks, or deny any knowledge, and appear politically impotent, with a government acting behind his back.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of increasing belligerence on both sides, development continued apace. Despite the setbacks the Americans were having though, true disaster wasn't far away for the Soviets.\n\nIn October 1960, the Soviets suffered a series of catastrophic setbacks to their aerospace and nuclear experiments. The worst of these undoubtedly came on the 24th, at the Tyuratam base, near the Baikonur Cosmodrome.\n\nThe Soviets were preparing for the first trial of the R-16, a completely new rocket designed to carry nuclear payloads. At the command of Marshal Nedelin, the Commander of the Force for Strategic Missiles, all the members of the State Commission were present for the test. The launch had been suffering a series of setbacks though, the test was repeatedly delayed. The first stage ignition had not fired successfully. Nedelin therefore demanded an immediate fix.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col-inverse col-right col-xs-5\">\n![The explosion at Tyuratam](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/nedelin.jpg)\n<figcaption>The exploding R-16, at Tyuratam</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nFrustrated at the continued delays, and feeling annoyed with the continual failure to launch, Nedelin left the command bunker and sat on a wooden chair at the foot of the rocket, surrounded by his senior staff in order to assist with the final preparations. This was a gross violation of procedure, and put both himself and his team in grave danger. There was no opportunity for questioning the orders given though, if only as KGB agents had been tasked with ensuring they were carried out.\n\nA short circuit in the replaced main sequencer however, caused the second stage engines, still mounted over the first stage which was now nearly fully fuelled, to fire.\n\nNedelin was killed, along with 91 senior officers and engineers.\n\n### Man Steps Beyond Earth\n\nBack in America, von Braun had his own problems. On January 31st, 1961, the American team had launched Mercury-Redstone 2, with Ham the chimp on-board. Issues with the flight however, caused von Braun to have to make a difficult decision: test the vessel again, having fixed the problems found, or launch the next rocket with a man on board. NASA had already decided who to send; Alan Shepard was to be the first American to pilot the rocket and become an astronaut. His team however weren't willing to send a human yet. Another test would be conducted first, before Shepard was to get his shot.\n\nMeanwhile, the Soviet team had chosen who they were to send. Yuri Gagarin was well liked by his fellow cosmonauts, and by his superiors. With Gherman Titov and Grigori Nelyubov as backups, he would be the first choice to send.\n\nKorolev however had other issues. Whilst he had the man to fly, he wasn't yet ready to send him. There were still lingering issues with the rocket. The question now was, which would be ready first - the Soviet rocket, or the American?\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col col-left col-xs-6\">\n![The Vostok 1 takes flight](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/Vostok_1.gif)\n<figcaption>The Vostok 1 takes flight</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIn the end, the Vostok 1 was prepared first. Because of weight constraints, there was no backup retrorocket engine to help the vessel descend. Instead, the spacecraft was loaded with 10 days of provisions to allow Gagarin to survive while the ship's orbit decayed in case the retrorockets failed. But there were a hundred other issues. For example, during the pre-launch preparations, it was decided to paint \"СССР\" on Gagarin's helmet in large red letters. It was still less than a year since Powers had been captured, and there was a fear that when he landed, local police could mistake Gagarin for a foreign agent, parachuting from an aircraft. The concern was so great about the vessel that some have rated the chances of success at just 50%.\n\nNevertheless, on April 12, 1961, 09:07 local time, Yuri Gagarin and the Vostock 1 took flight. Just three minutes later, the rocket reached 17,500 mph, the speed required to leave Earth's gravity. Then, a mere seven minutes later, Gagarin was able to look out the window, and having become the first human to experience weightlessness, and float in a man-made vessel, in space. Two hours later, he'd have returned, having flown entirely around the world, across sleeping America, and landed back on Earth, around 170 miles (280km) from Baikonur.\n\nOne can only imagine what went through the minds of the farmer and her daughter, watching Gagarin in his bright orange cosmonaut suit and large white helmet, landing near them by parachute. He later recalled:\n\n> \"When they saw me in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as I walked, they started to back away in fear. I told them, don't be afraid, I am a Soviet citizen like you, who has descended from space and I must find a telephone to call Moscow!\""

				"content": "### One Place Left to Go\n\nThe Americans, used to being second by this point, send Alan Shepard less than a month later. In contrast to the Gagarin's flight, Shepard's lasts 16 minutes, and travels just 300 miles. He was weightless for 6 minutes, and never reached orbit. It was enough to allow America to say they'd also put a man in space, but America needed a much bigger win.\n\nPrior to Gagarin reaching space, now US President John F. Kennedy hadn't been a particularly large supporter of the American manned space program. Having only been in the job for just over three months, it was a shock to be woken up, and told that the Soviets had managed what NASA had not. Just the previous month, NASA administrator James Webb had submitted a budget request to fund a Moon landing , aiming to be there before the end of the decade. Kennedy however rejected it, believing that the costs involved were just too high. He also had one eye on Vietnam and Laos, as well as the situations in Europe and Latin America. Indeed, in his inaugural address, he'd pledged to:\n\n> \"...pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success of liberty.\"\n\nGagarin's flight forced his hand though. In light of the success of the Vostok 1 mission, Kennedy knew how the American public would respond emotionally. The sense of humiliation and fear was palpable. Seeking advice, he tasked the new Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson with assessing the state of America's space program, and how NASA could rapidly advance and respond. The two options proposed in response were the establishment of an orbital space station, or putting a man on the Moon. Only those would carry the gravitas required to allow the American public to see itself as putting the Soviets back in their place. Johnson therefore turned to von Braun, who gave his estimates on the feasibility of each. Johnson brought the answers back to Kennedy, concluding that a manned Moon landing was difficult enough that neither side could currently achieve it, and that if they made it their sole aim, that the US could potentially beat the Soviets to the punch.\n\nKennedy took Johnson's advice, and launched what would become the Apollo program. He justified the colossal expenditure by emphasising the importance to national security and putting focus scientific and social endeavours. Now all that was left to do was to reassure the American people that all was in hand. So it was that the world watched in wonder in autumn of 1962, as John F. Kennedy spoke at Rice University on September 12th, announcing America's response. In no uncertain terms, the US laid down the gauntlet: they were sending men to the moon. The Soviets were welcome to beat them to it, if they could.\n\n> We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theatre of war. I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.\n>\n> There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?\n>\n>We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win."

				"content": "**As 1962 rolled around**, the Soviet and American teams were joined by a third in putting satellites into orbit, when in March the Soviet scientists put Kosmos 1 in orbit with the new R-12 rocket, followed by the UK's Ariel 1, sent by on-board American Thor-Delta rocket. The Americans though had their sights set on loftier goals, and on August 27, after the unsuccessful launch of Mariner 1, successfully launched Mariner 2 aboard an Atlas series rocket. Four months later, on December 14th, it became the first man-made probe to reach another planetary body, coming within 21,607 miles (34,773 km) of Venus. Its instruments sent back the first detailed information on another world, sensing temperatures, radiation, magnetic field data, as well as data on the solar winds. Similar plans were in place for a visit to Mars, planned by the Soviets. However, Mars 1 failed en route after five months, and the next two attempts failed to leave orbit.\n\nWhilst things may have been going well on both sides with regards to space, the Cuban Missile Crisis in October only went to prove how fragile the political situation was. \n\nSlowly but surely, the US was starting to retake the lead. As time marched on and the US-made Atlas and Saturn I series of rockets performed the role of putting objects and people into space for the Americans though, Wernher von Braun was looking towards a new generation of rocket; one with enough power to send man to the moon and back. And he wasn't the only one, as 7,000 miles away, Sergei Korolev was looking towards the same prize.\n\nKorolev however, was starting to fall ill. He'd suffered his first heart attack in 1960, and during his time being treated, had also been identified as suffering from a kidney disorder; a legacy of his time as a prisoner in the Gulag. He was warned by his doctors that if he continued to push himself as hard as he had been, that his body would not last much longer. Korolev however had become convinced that Khrushchev saw the space program purely as a propaganda tool, and, fearing its cancellation if it didn't continue to perform that function, he had continued to work with incredible fervour. Now, his health problems started to mount up. A bout of intestinal bleeding saw him rushed to hospital again.\n\nHis problems weren't just physical either. Vladimir Chelomei, working at another internal bureau had been busy working on a massively over-powered ICBM. The Proton rocket, another answer to the moon mission brief, would prove a simpler design, and eventually go on to prove so successful that it's still used today. Back in 1962 however, Chelomei had managed to secure funding and support through politics: he'd started employing members of Khrushchev's family.\n\nBy the early 60's, designs were well under way on both sides for systems to take a man to the moon. The chosen concepts created to respond to the challenge though couldn't have been more different.\n\n### Laying the Groundwork\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col-inverse col-xs-6 col-right\">\n![The Saturn V and N1-L3 rockets](/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/saturn_v_n1.jpg)\n<figcaption>The assembled Saturn V and N1-L3 rockets, to scale</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe challenge was, in principle, simple. Generate enough thrust to send a craft big enough out of the Earth's orbit. That meant doing one of two things - creating a few huge engines, or many smaller ones. Smaller engines were easier to build and test, but the greater number increased the likelihood of failure. Large engines means less engines to go wrong as long as they work, but getting them to work at all will be a herculean task. Compared to the construction of these rockets, the the vessels used for putting Sputnik and Gagarin in to space look simple. And it's not as though the teams are only working on the moon rockets - at the same time, with the launch of Mariner 4, the Americans managed what the Soviet Mars program failed to: conduct a successful fly-by of Mars. Later the same year, the US-made Ranger 7 returns high-resolution photos of the lunar surface.\n\nTo solve the problem of going to the moon though, NASA have decided to go with what they knew, albeit on a vast scale - fewer engines, but bigger.\n\nMuch bigger.\n\nMind-bogglingly bigger.\n\nFive massive engines, each one capable of creating the thrust of an entire Atlas rocket. Each one would weight around 18,500 lb (8,400 kg), stand 19 ft (5.8 m) tall and 12.3 ft (3.7 m) wide, and be capable of burning 5,683 pounds (2,578 kg) of oxidizer and fuel every *second* to produce an unimaginable 1,500,000 lbf (6.7 MN) of thrust, creating exhaust gases reaching 5,800 °F (3,200 °C).\n\nIt wasn't just the engines that were vast either. The rocket they'd power, the Saturn V, was so huge that even if they could build it, there was nowhere to assemble and launch it. Until now, all rocket launches and testing had been done at Launch Operations Center (LOC) at Cape Canaveral. Saturn V was planned to be 363 ft (111 m) tall though, and weigh 6,540,000 lb (2,970 tonnes). Further, the rocket was designed to be assembled vertically, which would need a hanger big enough to do so, along with a track to allow it to be transported entire on a mobile platform to a launch pad. There was no way to realistically adapt the Canaveral facility, so the decision was made to build a new LOC adjacent to Cape Canaveral on Merritt Island. Construction began in November of 1962.\n\nThe effect on the area was incredible. People flooded in, with space-related industries immediately repeat the benefit of the billions the American government threw at them. Coco beach became the playground of those around the area. The attitude of the time was work hard, play hard. It came to have some of the highest rates of divorce, sexually transmitted disease, drug use and alcoholism in the State of Florida. Indeed, the locals who supplied the enormous quantities of tranquillisers and sleeping pills used by those working on the space program, could tell when a launch would be to within 72 hours, even if nothing had been announced publicly, such was the massive increase in use of drugs sold prior to launches. The work was non-stop and never ending, with huge finance, massive political pressure and ground-breaking engineering creating a cocktail of pressure many relieved any way they could.\n\nIn something that would become a theme for this period though, the new LOC wasn't named until tragedy struck. Almost exactly a year later while travelling with his wife, Jacqueline and the Texan governor and his wife in the presidential limousine on Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas, President Kennedy was assassinated. He'd been to oversee the construction just a week earlier. The now President Lyndon B. Johnson, under Executive Order 11129, named the new LOC in Kennedy's honour.\n\n> Designating Certain Facilities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and of the Department of Defence, in the State of Florida, as the John F. Kennedy Space Center\n>\n> Whereas President John F. Kennedy lighted the imagination of our people when he set the moon as our target and man as the means to reach it; and\n>\n> Whereas the installations now to be renamed are a center and symbol of our country's peaceful assault on space; and\n>\n> Whereas it is in the nature of this assault that it should test the limits of our youth and grace, our strength and wit, our vigor and perseverance qualities fitting to the memory of John F. Kennedy;\n>\nNow, Therefore, by virtue of the authority in me as President of the United States, I hereby designate the facilities of the Launch Operations Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the facilities of Station No. 1 of the Atlantic Missile Range, in the State of Florida, as the John F. Kennedy Space Center; and such facilities shall be hereafter known and referred to by that name.\n>\n> Lyndon B. Johnson﻿\n>\n> The White House,\n>\n> November 29, 1963\n\nThe order joined both the civilian LOC and the still military-operated Cape Canaveral both under the designation *John F. Kennedy Space Center*, which had the unintended effect of creating a certain amount of confusion for the public. NASA Administrator James Webb clarified this by issuing a directive stating the Kennedy Space Center name applied only to the LOC, while the Air Force renamed the military site Cape Kennedy Air Force Station.\n\n### Engineering the Future\n\nThe only upside to the challenge posed by getting the Saturn V in to space was that these engines would only be needed for the first stage. The second and third stages could be powered by a much smaller engine, which could also be used on other rockets. For that, Rocketdyne (who would also build the Saturn V main engines) created the J-2 engine, which would also see service as the main engines for the Saturn IB rockets.\n\nAs for the Saturn V engine though, every single challenge faced in making such an engine was hard. The US Air Force had started work on an engine of the required size as far back as 1957, but eventually development after they realised there was nothing they could want that would require so much thrust. NASA, on the other hand, knew exactly what it would be useful for, and so contracted Rocketdyne to complete the development of what they'd named the F-1. The first static firing of the full engine had been performed in March 1959, but all had not gone well. The engine suffered from serious combustion instability problems, by which pressure waves would form in the combustion chamber. These could build and catastrophic failure, and destroy the entire engine. A problem, when von Brun needed five working flawlessly.\n\nEventually, the engineers at Rocketdyne had come up with an interesting way of working on the problem. They attached small C4 charges to the outside of the combustion chamber and set them off while the engine was firing. This allowed them to simulate the conditions of the vibrations produced, gathering data more safely and learning how to control the resonance. Eventually, they produced injector designs which were so stable, they could stop the charge-induced instabilities within 0.1 of a second."

In the Rocketdyne F-1, von Braun had found his engine. Now he just needed a rocket which could handle it.\n\nBack in Soviet Russia, records continued to be set. This time it was the turn of Valentina Tereshkova, who would become both the first woman and civilian into space, on Vostok 6. Korolev however continued to suffer from further ill-health. He had had been diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia, and soon after, inflammation of his gallbladder. Meanwhile, Khrushchev was deposed from power.\n\nMoreover, Chelomei had proposed an alternate to the moon landing mission suggested by Korolev, with much lower risk. Instead of sending men to land on the moon, he proposed a series of lunar orbit missions, which would be less challenging, and also offer a chance at beating the US. He also proposed a new rocket design, using the Valentin Glushko designed RD-270 engine; an engine as powerful as the American F-1. This would have allowd the construction of a much simpler rocket design, known as the UR-500. Politics in the Soviet Union continued to be troubling though, with a military reluctant to support what was seen as a political propaganda campaign, without an military benefit. Korolev and Chelomei though both still pushed for a lunar mission. Finally, Chelomei's program was merged with Korolev's, the teams being ordered to continue together. However, whilst Korolev has a potential design, he couldn't get the funding needed to build something on the scale of the N1-L3, and he and Glushko had a troubled relationship, and Korolev was unwilling to use an engine with the propellant the RD-270 used. Glushko on the other hand refused to work on a liquid oxygen/kerosene engine, and with Korolev in general. He left the project to work on the Proton design as well as others.\n\nIn the meantime, Korolev worked on smaller projects, and on the 18th March, 1965, Alexey Leonov became the first man to walk in space, whilst on the Voskhod 2 flight. Leonov exited the craft, and stayed outside for 12 minutes and nine seconds, whilst connected by just a 5.35-meter tether."

				"content": "At the end of the spacewalk though, whilst trying to re-enter the Voskhod 2, Leonov ran in to problems. His spacesuit, no longer contained by the air pressure of an atmosphere or the air of the ship, had inflated like a balloon, forcing him to return through the hatch head-first. Having done so though, he was faced with a second problem - the suit's continued size meant he was unable to turn around to close the outer hatch, nor to push himself back out to re-enter correctly. Using a release valve to manually vent air, he managed to reduce the pressure. After a tense moment, he managed to deflate the suit enough turn around and bend to close the hatch again. The incident was covered up at the time, and only later be revealed how close Leonov came to being stranded in space.\n\nThe problems didn't end there though. With only five minutes before they were scheduled to begin re-entry to return home, Leonov and his crew mate, Pavel Belyayev, discovered that the automatic guidance system wasn't functioning. As a result, they would have to fly the spacecraft manually. To make matters worse, they were now dangerously low on fuel. As they began their re-entry, things got still worse. In a replay of the Gagarin mission, the orbital and landing modules had stayed connected by a communications cable. The craft spun together until the cable burned through in the intense heat, allowing the craft to stabilise, finally coming to land in deep snow in Solikamsk, just outside Siberia, wedged against a birch tree which prevented the two men from getting out. Unable to be rescued that night, a helicopter pilot threw them supplies to wait out the night in temperatures that fell down to -22 °F (-30 °C). They were collected the next day, and reported their mission. Leonov said simply:\n\n> Provided with a special suit, man can survive and work in open space. Thank you for your attention.\n\nIt's not hard to guess what his feelings on the last few days had been. \n\n### An Ambitious Plan\n\nIn order to have any chance at building his rocket, Korolev needed an engine supplier. He turned to Nikolai Kuznetsov, a fairly inexperienced rocket designer, who developed the NK-15 and NK-15V engines for the project. It was an incredibly ambitious design. Whereas the Saturn V was to have five F-1 engines in its first stage, a further 5 smaller J-2 engines in the second and a final J-2 powering stage three, the N1-L3 was to have a more.\n\nA lot more.\n\nThe first stage alone had 30 NK-15 engines, 24 in a ring around the edge, and another six closer in. These together produced even more thrust than the already colossal figures of the Saturn V; a full 36% more. The second stage consisted of another eight NK-15s arranged in another ring, whilst the third carried four NK-21 engines. In total, Saturn V would carry 11 rocket motors. N1-L3 would have 42, all of which would have to work perfectly. For an unreliable engine, it was a huge ask.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, NASA were now surging ahead, launching a manned mission almost every two months. The time spent in space, including setting a two week endurance record for time in space, and practising docking manoeuvres are giving them the experience they need to launch a lunar mission. The Soviet team were falling behind with every month that passed.\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Saturn V</th>\n<th>N1-L3</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Diameter, maximum</td>\n<td>33 ft (10 m)</td>\n<td>56 ft (17 m)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Height w/ payload</td>\n<td>363 ft (111 m)</td>\n<td>344 ft (105 m)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gross weight</td>\n<td>6,478,000 lb (2,938,000 kg)</td>\n<td>6,030,000 lb (2,735,000 kg)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>First stage</strong></td>\n<td><strong>S-IC</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Block A</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thrust, SL</td>\n<td>7,500,000 lbf (33,000 kN)</td>\n<td>10,200,000 lbf (45,400 kN)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Burn time</td>\n<td>2 m 48 s</td>\n<td>2 m 5 s</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Second stage</strong></td>\n<td><strong>S-II</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Block B</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thrust, vac</td>\n<td>1,155,800 lbf (5,141 kN)</td>\n<td>3,160,000 lbf (14,040 kN)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Burn time, s</td>\n<td>6 m 24 s</td>\n<td>2 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Orbital insertion stage</strong></td>\n<td><strong>S-IVB (burn 1)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Block V</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thrust, vac</td>\n<td>202,600 lbf (901 kN)</td>\n<td>360,000 lbf (1,610 kN)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Burn time, s</td>\n<td>2 m 27 s</td>\n<td>6 m 10 s</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Orbital payload</td>\n<td>264,900 lb (120,200 kg)</td>\n<td>209,000 lb (95,000 kg)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Injection velocity</td>\n<td>25,568 ft/s (7,793 m/s)</td>\n<td>25,570 ft/s (7,793 m/s)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Earth departure stage</strong></td>\n<td><strong>S-IVB (burn 2)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Block G</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Thrust, vac</td>\n<td>201,100 lbf (895 kN)</td>\n<td>100,000 lbf (446 kN)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Burn time, s</td>\n<td>5 m 47 s</td>\n<td>7 m 23 s</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Translunar payload</td>\n<td>100,740 lb (45,690 kg)</td>\n<td>23,500 kilograms (51,800 lb)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Injection velocity</td>\n<td>35,545 ft/s (10,834 m/s)</td>\n<td>35,540 ft/s (10,834 m/s)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n### The Fall of a Giant\n\nKorolev had even larger issues though. The Soviet leadership weren't willing to release the funds requested, instead granting his team only half of what they'd asked for. This didn't leave time or money enough to build test facilities. Instead, the decision was taken to test the N1-L3 in the only way they could - by launching it. While it was being constructed, the team also worked on the Soyuz 7K-LOK, a spacecraft designed to be able to carry a crew to the moon, as well as acting as a mothership for an LK lander. If they could get the N1-L3 to work, they might have a shot at beating the Americans. They weren't his only issue though.\n\nThe program was running in to problems though. A lack of budget, an overly ambitious design, and a temperamental engine were one thing, but crisis was closer to hand. On the 5th January 1966, he was taken in to hospital for surgery. What happened in the hospital is still disputed, with various accounts stating different things. Whatever the truth though, it didn't go well. His health continued to deteriorate, during his time there.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col col-xs-6 col-left\">\n<img src=\"/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/korolyev_kremlin_wall.jpg\" alt=\"Korolev's tomb in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis\">\n<figcaption>Korolev's tomb in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nHe died nine days later, aged just 59.\n\nUnder a policy instigated by Stalin, which his successors continued, Korolev's identity had been kept a state secret. It was thus only that in death was he finally recognised both by his own people and the world at large for his incredibly accomplishments. His obituary was published in the Pravda newspaper, on the 16th of January 1966, accompanied by a photo of Korolev with all his medals. He man once renounced by his people and sentenced to hard labour was now honoured with a full state funeral in the Red Square, and his ashes interred in the Kremlin Wall.\n\n### The High Cost of Progress\n\nBack in America, the desperate race to fulfil the government's command was causing development to run at breakneck speed. In December of 1964, Gemini's 6 & 7 made the first rendezvous in space, eventually coming within 1 ft of each other. Gemini 6 would then go on to land within 10 miles (18 km) of the intended target site, making it the first accurate atmospheric reentry.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col-inverse col-xs-6 col-right\">\n<img src=\"/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/pacific_gemini_7.jpg\" alt=\"The Pacific, from Gemini 7\">\n<figcaption>The view of the Pacific ocean, from Gemini 7</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nApollo 1 was scheduled to have served as the first manned test flight of the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM), and was to orbit Earth having been launched atop a Saturn IB rocket. The aim was to test launch operations, the ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly, laying the groundwork for a Saturn V launch.\n\nDeke Slayton, who'd been one of the Mercury Seven, had been grounded after it had been found he had an erratic heart rate. Then grounded by the Air Force too, he'd become first unofficially, and then in 1963 officially the Coordinator of Astronaut Activities working as the head of astronaut selection. He had then moved on to become Director of Flight Crew Operations, and selected the first Apollo crew in January 1966. His choices were:\n\n* Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom as Command Pilot\n* Edward White as Senior Pilot\n* Donn Eisele as Pilot.\n\nEisele however suffered from dislocation of the shoulder twice while undergoing weightlessness training, and had to undergo surgery. In response, Slayton replaced him with Roger Chaffee, and NASA announced the crew selection on March 21, with James McDivitt, David Scott and Russell Schweickart named as the backup crew.\n\n<figure class=\"media_widget col col-xs-6 col-left\">\n<img src=\"/fly-me-to-the-moon/piece_images/a1prayer.jpg\" alt=\"The Apollo 1 crew photo\">\n<figcaption>The crew of Apollo 1 with a model of the Command Module. From left to right: Ed White, Gus Grissom, and Roger Chaffee</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAt the same time, NASA was examining the idea of conducting the Apollo 1 mission alongside the final Gemini mission, Gemini 12, in November, it soon became clear that the engineering involved would take far too long. Indeed, such was the over-run that the first flight test was moved back to February of 1967. This was not surprising though, given the scale of what was being done. The difficulties faced in creating the Apollo Command/Service Module were far beyond those faced by any module which had been sent up so far. In a spacecraft review meeting held with Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) Joseph Shea in August, the crew voiced their concerns with having flammable material in the cabin. It was certainly convenient, but the idea of having something flammable in a pure oxygen environment seemed like a bad idea. Shea however conditionally approved the Apollo design, leading to the crew giving him a portrait after their meeting, bearing the inscription:\n\n> It isn't that we don't trust you, Joe, but this time we've decided to go over your head.\n\nShea gave his staff orders to tell North American to remove the flammables from the cabin, but did not supervise the issue personally. That was far from the only thing to have needed changing though; in total 113 significant planned engineering changes were scheduled to be completed at Kennedy Space Center. Things continued to be developed on-site, leading to a total 623 engineering change orders being  made and completed after the module was delivered. Worse, every change had to be reflected in the training simulator, to ensure they astronauts were adequately prepared. As a result of the constant tweaking and interference, Grissom became so frustrated that he took a lemon from a tree near his home and hung it on the simulator. They knew what they were doing was dangerous, and in December he stated while being interviewed:\n\n> You sort of have to put that out of your mind. There's always a possibility that you can have a catastrophic failure, of course; this can happen on any flight; it can happen on the last one as well as the first one. So, you just plan as best you can to take care of all these eventualities, and you get a well-trained crew and you go fly.\n\nIt was a dangerous mix and something was bound to go wrong.\n\nOn January 27th 1967, at 06:30 and 54 seconds local time, it did."

				"content": "Immediately after the fire, to avoid appearance of a conflict of interest, NASA Administrator Webb asked President Johnson to allow NASA to handle the investigation, according to its established procedure. Webb's Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans then directed establishment of a review board, chaired by Langley Research Center director Floyd Thompson and consisting of eight other experts, including astronaut Frank Borman and spacecraft designer Maxime Faget. The Board issued its final report on April 5. The conclusions were challenging to say the least. More damning though were the words of flight director Gene Kranz. On the Monday morning after the disaster, Kranz called his branch and flight control team to a meeting, in which he expressed the values he attributed to NASA and spaceflight.\n\n> Spaceflight will never tolerate carelessness, incapacity, and neglect. Somewhere, somehow, we screwed up. It could have been in design, build, or test. Whatever it was, we should have caught it. We were too gung ho about the schedule and we locked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work. Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we. The simulators were not working, Mission Control was behind in virtually every area, and the flight and test procedures changed daily. Nothing we did had any shelf life. Not one of us stood up and said, 'Dammit, stop!' I don't know what Thompson's committee will find as the cause, but I know what I find. We are the cause! We were not ready! We did not do our job. We were rolling the dice, hoping that things would come together by launch day, when in our hearts we knew it would take a miracle. We were pushing the schedule and betting that the Cape would slip before we did.\n>\n> From this day forward, Flight Control will be known by two words: 'Tough' and 'Competent.' Tough means we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do. We will never again compromise our responsibilities. Every time we walk into Mission Control we will know what we stand for. Competent means we will never take anything for granted. We will never be found short in our knowledge and in our skills. Mission Control will be perfect. When you leave this meeting today you will go to your office and the first thing you will do there is to write 'Tough and Competent' on your blackboards. It will never be erased. Each day when you enter the room these words will remind you of the price paid by Grissom, White, and Chaffee. These words are the price of admission to the ranks of Mission Control.\n\n### The High Cost of Progress: Soyuz 1\n\nApollo 1 wasn't to be the only disaster of 1967 though. With the death of Korolev, Vasily Mishin, a solid engineer who had worked alongside Korolev for years as his right-hand man, was given the role of Chief Designer, where he he inherited both the ongoing missions, as well as the problem-child N1-L3 project. Only a few months later, he was faced a disaster of his own.\n\nSoyuz 1 was a manned spaceflight, launched successfully into orbit on 23 April 1967 with cosmonaut Colonel Vladimir Komarov aboard. It was the first crewed flight of the Soyuz spacecraft, and to be a solid demonstration of the Soviet's continued lead over the Americans, who were reeling from the Apollo 1 incident, and still a long way from getting an Apollo capsule into space. The mission though was plagued with technical issues from the very start.\n\nThe Soviet team had been struggling for a long period, due to budget cuts and the need to try and create a successful rocket capable of travel to the moon. This was therefore to be first Soviet manned spaceflight in over two years. Despite failures of the previous unmanned tests of the Soyuz, and the rockets which would launch it (Cosmos' 133 140), and a third attempted test flight malfunction causing the rocket to explode on the pad, the decision was taken to launch Komarov anyway. Too much time was slipping by, and it was becoming increasingly obvious that the Americans were pulling away. The Soviet leadership needed a solid win.\n\nPrior to launch, Soyuz 1 engineers are said to have reported over 200 design faults to party leaders, but their concerns were overruled. Yuri Gagarin was scheduled as the backup pilot for the mission, and well knew the design problems. In an attempt to save Komarov, the tried to have him bumped, knowing the leadership would not dare risk his life. Komarov refused to pass though, even though he believed it to be doomed. He viewed Gagarin as too valuable, and believed he might be made to fly anyway.\n\nThe problems almost immediately after entering space. One solar panel failed to unfold, leading to a power shortage. Then the orientation detectors malfunctioned, and then broke entirely, leaving the automatic stabilization system completely dead, and an only partially working manual backup.\n\nAs a result, the flight director decided to abort the mission. 5 orbits later, Komarov fired the Soyuz 1 retrorockets and reentered the Earth's atmosphere. Piloting the broken ship, incredibly, he made it through the atmosphere. To finally slow the descent for landing, first the drogue parachute was deployed, followed by the main parachute. However, the main parachute did not unfold, and when he manually deployed reserve chute, it became tangled with the initial drogue chute, which had not released.\n\nThe ship slammed into the ground at almost 90 mph (140 km/h). A rescue helicopter spotted the descent module lying on its side with the parachute spread across the ground. The retrorockets then started firing which concerned the rescuers since they were supposed to activate a few moments prior to touchdown. Komarov was killed on impact, becoming sadly the first in-flight fatality in the history of spaceflight. He would not be the last."
