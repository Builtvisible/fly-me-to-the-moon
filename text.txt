**The date is August 2nd, 1955**. The USSR responds to the American declaration of intent, just four days earlier, to put satellites in to space, with a simple message: if you want to do it, we'll do it too, and faster. These two announcements come during the escalating the Cold War. Tensions are increasing, with both sides having recently demonstrated the capability to create a portable hydrogen bomb. With the memory of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki both still less than ten years old, the prospect of weapons with a thousand times the power ushers in the era of \"duck and cover\". And yet, the still infant science of rocketry, developed in the aftermath of World War II, promises more than just the prospect of global annihilation. It's a time when both countries, using the knowledge of their captured German engineers, have begun developing modern rocket arsenals to create intercontinental ballistic missiles. It will culminate in a mere 14 years with men walking on the surface of the moon, and spawn a legacy that continues onwards to today's exploration of the solar system and beyond. 

Our story begins however, at the end stages of the Second World War.

### The Bloody Phoenix

Towards the end of WW2 in 1944, Hitler's Nazi Germany faced catastrophic defeat. With his options limited, he ordered the use of a new, secret weapon. Designed as a tool to retaliate against the bombing of German cities by the allies, this weapon can travel at four times the speed of sound, travel 200 miles, cross the boundary of space, and deliver almost a tonne of explosive.

It was called the Vergeltungswaffe 2 (Retribution Weapon 2), or simply the V-2 for short.

<figcaption>The V-2 rocket assembled in the Peenemünde Museum</figcaption>

Then U.S. Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps, is ordered to a top secret meeting convened by the British, which will discuss the V-2 rocket. His superior, Colonel Holger Toftoy has orders to capture a V-2 at any cost. The Americans have realised that if they can create their own variant on the V-2, and combine it with their own secret project, the atom bomb, they will have military superiority over the rest of the world for years to come.

Toftoy gave Staver a simple order: capture the lead German scientist on the V-2 project, a man called Wernher von Braun. Von Braun was, at the time, stationed in Peenemünde in northern Germany, but the Americans had a problem. The Soviets were currently in Poland, pushing the Nazi forces back, where they'd discovered something the Americans would have literally killed for - the intact shell of a V-2, abandoned in the retreat. They already had the vessel, and in days, they'd reach von Braun.

While the Soviet forces were less than 100 miles away, von Braun assembled his planning staff and gave them a choice. They would be attacked soon, and their research was too valuable to be lost. As a result, he presented them with two simple options: surrender to the Soviets, or the allied forces of the West. Afraid of the Soviet forces and their reprisals against Germans, even prisoners of war, von Braun and his staff decided on the latter, and to surrender to the Americans if possible. Fortuitously, they have been given two conflicting sets of orders: to relocate to central Germany, and also to join the army and fight. They believed that the former offered the greatest chance of giving an opportunity to defect to the advancing American forces, von Braun moved his people to close to Nordhausen, to the Mittelwerk facility, where they resumed their work. Determined to continue his progress, he knows that whilst the rockets they're working on can be used for destruction, he can also see their potential for manned use.

By March, the Soviets are on the outskirts of Berlin. However, for all the the Nazi regieme is about to fall, they aren't any closer to capturing von Braun or his team. Preparing for the possibility they may not be able to reach them before the Americans do, they decide to put together a team to work on rocketry in the absence of the Nazi scientists. There was just one problem. The man who they needed to lead the team, and the man recommended by their leading rocket scientist (Ivan Kleymyonov), had been sent to the Gulag, put after being tortured and forced to confess to deliberately slowing research into rockets. That man was Sergei Korolev. Currently, Korolev was in a Sharashka, a Soviet prison for intellectual prisoners. Slave labour camps in all but name, those there were forced to work on projects dictated by the Soviet party.

In April, as the Allied forces advanced into Germany, von Braun and his top 500 scientists were ordered to the Bavarian Alps. The Americans were getting too close, and the fear was that the scientists and their research would fall into enemy hands. Ordered to destroy their research, von Braun instead had his men hide their papers in a disused mine, destroying as much as they needed to to appear to be following orders. Then, under guard by the SS, who were given orders to execute the team if they were over-run and to fall into enemy hands, or if Germany lost the war, they set off on a train to the Alps. The soldiers sent were fanatical and on edge, and knew the end would occur in weeks at most.

</figure>

Only days after they left, the Americans arrived and found the remains of the V-2 mass production plant which had produced over 5,000 V-2 rockets. It wasn't empty though - in the rush to leave, the Nazi forces had left 100 intact V-2 rockets. They also found the slave labour and concentration camp nearby, Mittelbau-Dora. Over 20,000 dead were found there, with another 40,000 survivors freed. More were killed creating the rockets, than by their use. The American team called in Staver and his people, who released immediately what this represented. He ordered the rockets to be broken down and shipped back, starting the single largest movement of material for the entire war. Knowing that the factory would fall under Soviet control, Staver was given less than a month to complete the operation.

At the same time, Korolev had been recalled from the Gulag and transported to Germany, to work under Dmitriy Ustinov, with Korolev serving as a chief designer of long-range missiles at the Special Design Bureau 1 (OKB-1). OKB-1 had been given the brief of research and design with regards to the V-2 rocket, aiming at advancing the technology for Soviet purposes.

Back in the Alps, von Braun was able to convince the SS Major in charge that if they were grouped together, they'd be an easy target for the US bombing raids and other retaliatory strikes. They were therefore ordered to spread out into a collection of villages. As a result, when it was announced that Hitler had committed suicide and the SS troops went to find the scientists, they only found empty beds. Von Braun and his people had swiftly fled to Austria, the moment they could. On May 2, 1945, upon finding an American private from the U.S. 44th Infantry Division, von Braun's brother and fellow rocket engineer, Magnus, approached the soldier on a bicycle, calling out in broken English:

> \"My name is Magnus von Braun. My brother invented the V-2. We want to surrender.\"

### The Post-War Scientists

In 1943, Werner Osenberg, the head of the German Military Research Association, or Wehrforschungsgemeinschaft, had created a list of the top scientists and engineers of the age. In 1945, Staver managed to get hold of that list, and used it to create a hit list of people the Americans wanted to capture. At the top, was von Braun. His knowledge would, they knew, prove invaluable. Thus the capture of von Braun was a huge coup of the Americans, and the loss felt by the Soviets, despite their creation of their own team, was equally huge. Stalin's reaction perhaps best sums up the feeling of the Soviet leadership:

> \"This is absolutely intolerable. We defeated the Nazi armies; we occupied Berlin and Peenemunde, but the Americans got the rocket engineers. What could be more revolting and inexcusable?\"

Staver was then tasked with Operation Overcast, the American plan to interrogate the German scientists. What von Braun and the others had to say though made him decide to write to his superiors, and urge their evacuation. As it grew, the beginnings of Operation Paperclip were forming. In total, over 1,500 German intellectuals would be brought to America from previously occupied European countries, with the aims of denying the advanced German scientific expertise to the Soviet Union and United Kingdom, whilst also preventing Germany from redeveloping its military research.

Von Braun was taken to America shortly after, and along with over 100 of his men he was escorted to Fort Bliss, whilst the Soviets were left with the now derelict V-2 plant. However, the Soviets didn't realise just how outmatched they currently were, until the 6th August, 1945. With the bombing of Hiroshima, and then Nagasaki shortly after, they realised that the Americans now had both the intelligence with which to make long range rockets, and a payload that could flatten cities. This was a terrifying, and immediate threat.

Back in Nordhausen , the Soviets put out a call for anyone who'd worked on the V-2 rockets to come and help them restart the rocket facility and to continue their research. A few did, including Helmut Gröttrup, wouldn't been von Braun's assistant and had developed the radio guidance system for the V-2. Having helped the Soviets get a V-2 engine to fire, he's promised that he can stay in Germany. In short order however, on 22 October 1946, he was betrayed. He and the other newly captured engineers, were deported to Moscow with their families as part of Operation Osoaviakhim. Over 2,000 other German intellectuals were moved with him, deported to Russia to aid the Soviet research programs. Once there, they were tasked with reproducing the technical drawings for the V-2, to enable research to begin again. It would take two years to compile the entire new set of blueprints. The rockets constructed had a dismal record though, and shortly after, research would begin on the R-1, the first Soviet rocket system. It had it's first launch scheduled for the 17th September 1948. Trials and refinement of the missile continued, until on the 25th November 1950, it was accepted into service. For Gröttrup and his team however, it was the beginning of the end of their usefulness. Too powerful, and too useful, they hid them away, and consigned them to quiet work, back in Germany.

In the meantime, things weren't going well in America for von Braun and his people. The program had become nicknamed Operation Icebox, due to the lack of activity. The captured Germans were kept isolated, but given no work, left to their own devices. The American military had decided to focus on air and submarine delivery systems for their weapons, rather than rocketry, leaving their captured geniuses in a state of limbo.

### The Cold War Heightens

In 1952, tensions between the USSR and America grew further, as America tested the first hydrogen bomb, then the most powerful weapon ever detonated, and by a huge margin. Ivy Mike as it was known, was an 74 tonne building, designed to test the theory of a Teller-Ulam fusion bomb. 

The 10.4 megaton blast was almost 700 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima. It left a crater 1.2 miles wide and 164 feet (50 metres) deep and blasted radioactive coral into the stratosphere, from where it fell to land on ships as far as 35 miles away. The Soviets responded by detonating their own a year later. Which didn't exactly cool things down.

Whilst Gröttrup had been sidelined at the turn of the 50's, Sergei Korolev was still active and had been tasked with a new challenge: create a rocket with enough range to reach America, whilst carrying a five tonne payload, the expected weight of a thermonuclear device. Meanwhile, in back America, von Braun was tasked with creating short range rockets, his dreams of creating rockets to send humans to space in tatters. Instead, they were working on the Hermes series of rockets, which were around 25% of the size of a V-2, with a maximum range of just 38 miles. 

And then, in 1953, whilst working on the Hermes A-3B (a slightly larger rocket), funding was cut, and a year later, the project was canned entirely. Von Braun himself was the focus of attacks by the US media, who reminded the public of his history as an officer in the SS. During this time though, he'd realised that if the military wouldn't take notice of his ideas, maybe he could win the support he needed appealing to the American public.

</figure>

On May 14, 1950, shortly after he and his team were transferred to Huntsville, Alabama, and the beginning of the Korean War, The Huntsville Times published the article \"Dr. von Braun Says Rocket Flights Possible to Moon\". At the same time, his team had started work on the Redstone rocket, which led to both the development of the first high-precision inertial guidance system, and a launch system capable of carrying a nuclear payload. His concepts in his ongoing writings, which included ideas for a space station would, in 1968, be presented on the silver screen as the basis for Space Station V in 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, it was his work with Walt Disney's Disney studios as technical director that initially let him bring his vision to the public at scale. \"Man in Space\", aired on March 9, 1955, drawing 42 million viewers and becoming unofficially the second-highest rated television show in American history. Von Braun had found a way to tap into the American public's consciousness, in a way he'd never been able to truly manage with the military. Overnight, he became a household name, and behind the scenes, things start to go his way.

Back in Russia, Korolev was busy working on his ideas for putting a satellite into space. Korolev therefore teamed up with Valentin Glushko, a genius rocket engine designer working at OKB 456. The two men had worked together previously building RD-1 KhZ, a rocket motor designed to be attached to a Lavochkin La-7R fighter plane to help protect Russia from high-altitude Luftwaffe attacks. Now Korolev proposed a unique idea: the R-7; a rocket with four detachable rockets which would fall away to leave a central rocket to continue on. Glushko would design the engines, Korolev the rocket. Such a system could both act as the delivery system the military want, and put Korolev's satellites into space. There were only three problems. Firstly, no-one had ever built anything close to such a rocket, secondly, the military had no interest in satellites, and three, it would be so huge, there was nowhere where it could be built.

The first would be overcome by research, the second didn't matter to his military backers who could use it to deliver warheads, and the third? Well, the third would result in the creation of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan, the world's first and largest operational space launch facility. 

<figure class=\"media_widget\">

</figure>

America, however, had other ideas. Whilst Korolev couldn't sell the idea of satellites to the Russians, America liked the idea. Under the cover of launching a scientific instrument, but actually wanting to develop orbital spying technology, America announced its intention to put a satellite in space. At the same time as von Braun was applying for, and receiving citizenship of the United States, ten years after leaving Germany, he found himself bidding against the US Navy for a satellite contract. Just at the point where Korolev was on the verge of a breakthrough, von Braun received the news that the contract had been awarded to the Navy. His dreams would have to wait for another day. For Korolev though, they were about to come true.

### Sputnik

While visiting the Baikonur facility, then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was shown the R-7, and Korolev was able to argue for sending his satellite project. Finally, after pointing out the Americans would get there first if the Soviets didn't, Khrushchev gave the go ahead. Dozens of institutes were involved in what became known as Project D. This turned into a logistical nightmare though, and the project dragged. Far worse though, on the first two tests of the R-7 rocket, the massively complex system with its 32 rocket engines and 280 tonne weight, failed disastrously.

As the Cold War escalated and the weapons became ever larger, finally the American military condescended to give von Braun his funding and to build medium range rockets. However, the focus was still very much on a delivery system for weapons payloads. The result was the Jupiter-C. Far smaller and simpler than the Russian R-7 rocket, it would nonetheless be more than capable of putting a small satellite into orbit. In fact, the administration was so suspicious of von Braun and his team, that inspectors from the Pentagon were sent to monitor the maiden launch, to ensure they didn't try and send a satellite up anyway. Despite the interference, and suspicion, von Braun's launch was a success. America now had a rocket capable of putting systems into orbit. The balance had shifted back in America's favour.

In Baikonur, on 21 August 1957, after two failed launches, Korolev was in a difficult situation. His rocket, massively ambitious but also massively complex, had eaten vast amounts of both time and money, and so far had nothing to show for it other than two very expensive fireworks shows. As a result, tensions must have been high. But thankfully, at 12:25, the R-7 launches successfully for the first time. The world now has its first intercontinental ballistic missile. In the meantime, massively frustrated at the increasing complexity, as well as the design and construction issues with the Project D satellite, his team have been working hard to re-develop the concept to something far simpler. In less than a month, they design and build and entire new system. The new design, consisting of little more than a polished metal sphere, a transmitter, thermal measuring instruments, and batteries, weighed about the same as a man.

Finally on 4 October 1957, at 19:28, on an R-7, the R-7 launched, and at 00:03, Sputnik became the first object to be placed in orbit by mankind. The USSR had won the race to space.

### A Call to Space

The effects on the two world superpowers couldn't have been more different. In the USSR, Khrushchev was pleased with this success, and decreed that it should be followed up by an encore for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, on November 3rd, just 30 days away. The result of that would be Sputnik 2. In the US though, the launch was met with incredulity and disbelief. Indeed, Vice President Richard Nixon proclaimed it a hoax. When they realised however that both the launch and Sputnik were in fact real, the collective Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program must more advanced than it actually was. This was a belief Khrushchev was more than happy to encourage, as he stated in an interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed.

The result of Khrushchev's pronouncement was Sputnik 2, which put the first living creature in to space; a small stray dog, named Laika. Before the launch, Dr. Vladimir Yazdovsky, one of the scientists on the project, took Laika home to play with his children. In a book chronicling the story of Soviet space medicine, he remembered:

> \"I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live.\"

Sadly, after only a few hours in space, Laika died of overheating, a fact that wasn't revealed until as recently as 2002.

Finally, after years of being held back, and being told that the US Navy must be given a shot before he can have his turn, von Braun is given the go-ahead to attempt to put an American satellite into orbit. He named it Explorer. The Navy prepared it's own Vanguard rocket, which was as then untested. The world's media turned up, watched the rocket lift three feet from the pad, and then explode in a huge fireball. The only surviving piece was the satellite, which fell to the ground and began to transmit. The press response was scathing, labelling it "Kaputnik" and other less than flattering names. As Time Magazine noted:

> But in the midst of the cold war, Vanguard's cool scientific goal proved to be disastrously modest: the Russians got there first. The post-Sputnik White House explanation that the U.S. was not in a satellite "race" with Russia was not just an after-the-fact alibi. Said Dr. Hagen ten months ago: \"We are not attempting in any way to race with the Russians.\" But in the eyes of the world, the U.S. was in a satellite race whether it wanted to be or not, and because of the Administration's costly failure of imagination, Project Vanguard shuffled along when it should have been running. It was still shuffling when Sputnik's beeps told the world that Russia's satellite program, not the U.S.'s, was the vanguard.

Whether the US wanted to be in a race was irrelevant - the media had deemed it so, and now it was up to them to respond. With no other option, the administration gave von Braun and his team their shot.

On the 31st January 1958, at 22:48, von Braun's Juno I, a Jupiter-C derived rocket, launched with Explorer on-board. Less than two hours later, America had its own satellite. The race to put a man in space was on.
